Why did the number of billionaires double between 2009 and 2014?

## Strange headlines

According to a recent [CNBC article][1] the number of billionaires doubled since the
financial crisis. I was a bit curious about the connection to the stock market doubling
as well since the financial crisis so I decided to investigate if the number of 
billionaires in the USA roughly corresponded to the SP500 as it is a relatively 
standard measure of the US stock market. Also since many billionaires like Bill Gates
derive their wealth from ownership of a public company I figured my guess couldn't be
too far off the mark.

## Results
My [results][2] per my original hypothesis were slightly disappointing. Although the 
SP500 doubled from 2009 to 2014, the number of billionaires in the US did not. In fact
they only topped 2008 levels in 2014. My other concern is that a large number of billionaires
did not actually make their riches solely through ownership of one public company, but
rather interest in many different companies or ownership of a privately held corporation.
